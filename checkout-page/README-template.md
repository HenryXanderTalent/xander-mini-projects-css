## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

View a standard layout for a coffee shop checkout interface.

<!-- - View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page-->
### Screenshot

<!--Add a screenshot of your solution. The easiest way to do this is to use Firefox to view your project, right-click the page and select "Take a Screenshot". You can choose either a full-height screenshot or a cropped one based on how long the page is. If it's very long, it might be best to crop it.

Alternatively, you can use a tool like [FireShot](https://getfireshot.com/) to take the screenshot. FireShot has a free option, so you don't need to purchase it. 

Then crop/optimize/edit your image however you like, add it to your project, and update the file path in the image above.

**Note: Delete this note and the paragraphs above when you add your screenshot. If you prefer not to add a screenshot, feel free to remove this entire section.**-->

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
<!-- - Mobile-first workflow-->

### What I learned

<!--Use this section to recap over some of your major learnings while working through this project. Writing these out and providing code samples of areas you want to highlight is a great way to reinforce your own knowledge.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
```
```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  color: papayawhip;
}
```

If you want more help with writing markdown, we'd recommend checking out [The Markdown Guide](https://www.markdownguide.org/) to learn more.

The main area I developed in was learning the CSS Grid so now I can confidently use it going forward.

Example below:

.items {
    grid-column: 1 / 2;
    grid-row: 1 / 10;
    background-color: #eee1d5;
    border-radius: 3px;
    margin-top: 25px;
    display: grid;
    grid-template-rows: 10% repeat(auto-fill, 1fr);
    grid-template-columns: 10% 80% 10%;
    box-shadow: 0px 2px 3px #885a2d;
    margin-right: 20px;
}

### Continued development

<!--Use this section to outline areas that you want to continue focusing on in future projects. These could be concepts you're still not completely comfortable with or techniques you found useful that you want to refine and perfect.

I will find the time in the near future to recreate this design using the CSS Flexbox feature.

### Useful resources

- [Learn CSS Grid - A 13 Minute Deep Dive](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EiNiSFIPIQE) - This video helped me to quickly understand how to implement CSS Grid and I will use it going forward.
